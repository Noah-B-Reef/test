    Let's start with a couple of intervals and see if either has a largest element. The set of real numbers is denoted by <m>\R</m>.
    throughout the book, and the notation <q><m> x \in \R</m></q> means that <m>x</m> is a real number.

        Consider the closed interval <m>F</m> and open interval <m>G</m> in <xref ref="one-point-one-point-one"/> given by

  <p>
    Do you know what I mean by <q>largest element</q> exactly? How is <q>large</q> used in this context? The following
    definition of <em>upper bound, maximum, lower bound,</em> and <em>minimum</em> codify the context and allow us to prove results
    in a rigorous way.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def-up-max">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A real number <m>b</m> is an <em>upper bound</em> of a set of real numbers <m>S</m> if for every <m>x</m> in <m>S</m>, 
        we have <m>x \leq b</m>. In this case, we say <m>S</m> is <em>bounded above</em>. A real number <m>q</m> is a <em>maximum</em> of <m>S</m> if <m>q</m> is an upper bound of <m>S</m>
         and <m>q</m> is an element of <m>S</m>. That is,
         <ol marker="i">
           <li>for every <m>x</m> in <m>S</m> we have <m>x \leq q</m>, and</li>
           <li><m>q</m> is in <m>S</m></li>
          In this case, we write <m>q = \max S</m>.
        </ol>
      </p>


  <p>
    Similarly, a real number <m>a</m> is a <em>lower bound</em> for a set of real numbers <m>S</m> if for every <m>x</m> in <m>S</m>, 
    we have <m>a \leq x</m>. In this case, we say <m>S</m> is <em>bounded below</em>. A real number <m>v</m> is the <em>minimum</em> of <m>S</m> if <m>v</m> 
    is a lower bound of <m>S</m> and <m>v</m> is an element of <m>S</m>. That is,

    <ol marker="i">
      <li value="3">for every <m>x</m> in <m>S</m> we have <m>v \leq x</m>, and</li>
      <li value="4"><m>v</m> is in <m>S</m></li>
    </ol>

    In this case, we write <m>v = \min S</m>.
  </p>
</statement>
</definition>
  <p>
    Let's use <xref ref="def-up-max"/> to prove a couple facts about <m>F</m> and <m>G</m>.
  </p>
  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Prove that the interval <m>F = (-\infty, 3140]</m> has a largest element. In other words, <m>\max F</m> exists.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <solution>
      <p>
        By checking the properties of <xref ref="def-up-max"/>, since <em>(i)</em> <m>x \leq 3140</m> for every <m>x</m> in <m>F</m>
        (thus <m>3140</m> is an upper bound of <m>F</m>), and <em>(ii)</em> <m>3140</m> is in <m>F</m>, the interval <m>F</m> has a maximum-
        its largest element-given by <m>\max F = 3140</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>

  </example>
