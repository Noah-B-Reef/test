  <title>Kernel of Analysis</title>

  <introduction>
    <blockquote>
      <title>Kernel of Analysis</title>
      <p>
        A point is <em> arbitrarily close</em> to a set when every neighborhood of the point intersects the set.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This notion of <em> arbitrarily close</em> provides the theme of the book and the kernel of analysis. 
      It allows us to build a foundation for classic results in real analysis dealing with closure, limits and convergence, 
      connectedness, continuity, differentiation and integration.<fn> <em>Arbitrarily  close</em> is actually topological in nature since we can take 
      <em>neighborhoods</em> to be open sets containing the point in question.</fn>
